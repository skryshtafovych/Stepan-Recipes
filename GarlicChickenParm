Ingredients
 
For the Chicken
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter
2 Chicken Breasts, , butterflied
Seasoned Croutons, , crushed
Jarred Marinara of Choice
8 Ounces Mozzarella, Sliced

For the Sandwich
4 Hoagie rolls, or French Baguettes
1 Stick Unsalted Butter, softened
Garlic Salt with Herbs, we prefer Johnny's Garlic Spread from Costco
Instructions
Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil and place 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large pan and heat to medium high heat.
Meanwhile, dredge the chicken in the finely crushed croutons on both sides.
Place 2 breasts at a time in the pan and after a minute turn down to medium low. Cook for 5 minutes (consult how to cook chicken in a pan) and flip, cooking another 5-7 minutes or until cooked through to 160 degrees. Remove to a plate, add more butter and oil and repeat with remaining chicken. Set aside.
Meanwhile, prepare the pesto.
Butter the insides of the bread and sprinkle with garlic salt. Heat the oven to broil and cook open faced until golden. Remove to set aside.
Add a spoonful or two of sauce to the bottom bread and place the chicken on top.
Cover the chicken in the sauce and add mozzarella.
Place under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly, then top with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and add a smear of pesto to brighten the meal. Top with the other bread and dig in!
Notes
The pesto can be made a day early. You can use jarred sauce to save time or our bolognese is incredible for this dish.
